Step 1: 
Create 3 dots that form 3 points on a circle.
Then draw the circle that is formed by said 3 dots.
Create 2 "edge dots" and 1 "mid dot"
Only render the parts of the circle between the edges. 
Add more Arcs
Connect Arcs so the derivative's continuity is preserved
Add straight edge
Create a track
